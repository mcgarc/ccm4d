In this section we will see how the combined vibrational, rotational and
electronic structure can be seen in the spectra of a diatomic molecules. The
description given here will not be a full quantum treatment (see H \& W ch. 17).

\subsection{Electronic structure}

% TODO Density functional theory (DFT) for compmuting ground states

As discussed in section \ph{reference, or fix} the electronic structure of a
diatomic molecule can be thought of in terms of the two constituent atoms being
brought together from infinite separation. If the inter-nuclear separation is
$R$ then clearly when $R \to \infty$ we would expect the electronic structure to
be that of two separate atoms, as described in texts such as
Foot~\cite{Foot2005}.

\ph{We have already discussed} decreasing $R$ for two \Hy atoms in their ground
state, which guides us to the gerade and ungerade electron wavefunctions for the
ground state of a \dihydrogen molecule. We will now consider the result of bringing
together larger atoms.

\subsubsection{Molecular orbital theory}

%TODO I wrote a fair bit of this based on HandW sec. 13 and talking to Freddy,
%needs proper citation and a bit more research.

%Molecular orbital (MO) theory is describes to good (how good?) approxiation the electron
%orbitals for small (how small)
%homonuclear (really? if so why not heteronuclear?) diatmoic molecules.
Recall that for \dihydrogen in the ground state, the 1s atomic orbital was split into the
even and uneven molecular orbitals
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_\text{g,u} 1\mathrm{s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( 1\mathrm{s}_a \pm
  1\mathrm{s}_b ).
\end{equation}
%
What will we see happen for higher orbitals? Consider \dilithium. We know that
for \lithium the atomic structure is $\text{1s}^2\text{2s}$. We can anticipate
that the 1s orbitals will mix in the same way as before, and that the 2s
orbitals will independently mix in the same way. We now have four molecular
orbitals, which we label 2s$\sigma^*$, 2s$\sigma$, 1s$\sigma^*$, and 1s$\sigma$.
The corresponding molecular orbit diagram is shown in
\myfigref{diaspec:fig:LiMO}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the Li MO diagram as can be foudn on the MO
  WIki page.}
  \label{diaspec:fig:LiMO}
\end{figure}

The orbitals will be filled according to the same rules as for atoms~\cite{}:
%
% TODO expand
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aufbau
    \item Pauli
    \item Hund
\end{enumerate}
%
We can see that in \dilithium that there are four electrons in bonding orbitals
and only two in anti-bonding orbitals. The overall energy contribution of the
bond is negative, so \dilithium is a stable molecule.

Now briefly consider \ce{He2}, shown in \myfigref{diaspec:fig:HeMO}. Here the
energy contribution to the bond is net positive (there are an equal number of
electrons in bonding and anti-bonding orbitals) so this is an unstable
configureation. This is as we expect, \ce{He} is a noble gas after all. However,
if one of the 1s$\sigma^*$ electrons is excited into 2s$\sigma$ then the
\ce{He2} molecule becomes stable. HTis is called an excimer.

% TODO : N2 and O2, maybe should do something smaller without the swap?

% Next part should be something like MO theory doesn't cover absolutely
% everything. Swapping at N2 cutoff and go over HW fig. 13.5

\subsection{Nuclear motion}

\subsection{Raman spectroscopy}

Raman scattering describes the process of the interaction of off-resonant light
with a molecule.  Light incident on a diatomic molecule will induce a dipole
moment
%
\begin{equation}
  p(t) = \alpha E_0 \cos(2\pi\nu_p t)
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ is the polarisability of the molecule, and $E_0$ and $\nu_p$ are
the amplitude and frequency of the electric field respectively.

For all diatomic molecules, the polarisability is a function of the
inter-nuclear separation \cite{}, which can be expanded to first order
%
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \alpha(R) = \alpha(R_0) + \frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R}(R - R_0).
\end{equation}
%
This is where the vibration of the molecule comes into play, because of course
$R$ changes through time as the molecule vibrates. We can write down
%
\begin{equation}
R = R_0 + q \cos (2\pi \nu_\text{vib} t)
\end{equation}
and hence the dipole moment is
\begin{equation}
p(t) = \left[ \alpha(R_0) + \frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R} q\cos (2\pi\nu_\text{vib}t)
\right] E_0 \cos(2\pi\nu_p t).
\end{equation}
Expanding this out we retrieve
\begin{equation}
p(t) = \alpha(R_0)E_0\cos(2\pi\nu_p t) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R}
E_0 q \left\{ \cos\left[ 2\pi(\nu_p + \nu_\text{vib})t\right]
+ \cos\left[ 2\pi(\nu_p - \nu_\text{vib})t\right] \right\}.
\end{equation}

Hence from the first order of $\alpha(R)$ we have found that the vibrational
spectrum of a diatomic molecule has a principle line at $\nu_p$ and sidebands at
$\nu_p \pm \nu_\text{vib}$. Clearly expansion to higher orders of $\alpha(R)$
will yield higher-order sidebands. This is the \emph{Raman spectrum} of the
molecule. Negative sidebands are \emph{Stokes lines} and positive are
\emph{anti-Stokes}.
%
The Raman spectrum (including the rotational contribution, which we have not yet
discussed) is shown in Figure \ref{diaspec:fig:totalraman}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the Raman spectrum, similar to H\&W 12.1}
  \label{diaspec:fig:totalraman}
\end{figure}

Upon scattering the photon, the molecule is excited to a virtual level. When the
excited state decays, it can fall back into the same level (\emph{Rayleigh
scattering}), a higher vibrational state (\emph{Stokes scattering}) or a lower
vibrational level (\emph{anti-Stokes scattering}). These processes are
illustrated in \myfigref{diaspec:fig:ramanscatter}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the possible Raman scattering processes, some
  hybrid of the Wikipedia fig. and H\&W fig. 12.3.}
  \label{diaspec:fig:ramanscatter}
\end{figure}

The relative intensity of each line in the Stokes spectrum can be found by
considering the relative population of each vibrational level. These will be
populated according to a Boltzman distribution, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{I_\text{anti}}{I_\text{Stokes}} = \frac{n(v=1)}{n(=0)} = e^{-\beta h
  \nu_\text{vib}}.
\end{equation}
%
A typical value of $\nu_\text{vib}$ is \SI{30}{\tera\hertz} and at room
temperature (\SI{300}{\kelvin}) this results in a 0.7\% relative intensity. At
ultracold temperatures (\SI{10}{\micro \kelvin}) the relative intensity is
approximately zero ($e^{- 10^8}$).

\subsubsection{Rotational spectrum}

We will now describe the origin of the scattering lines either side of each
Rayleigh and (anti-)Stokes line in the Raman spectrum, as depicted in
\myfigref{diaspec:fig:totalraman}.
