In this section we will see how the combined vibrational, rotational and
electronic structure can be seen in the spectra of a diatomic molecules. The
description given here will not be a full quantum treatment (see H \& W ch. 17).

\subsection{Electronic structure}

% TODO Density functional theory (DFT) for compmuting ground states

As discussed in section \ph{reference, or fix} the electronic structure of a
diatomic molecule can be thought of in terms of the two constituent atoms being
brought together from infinite separation. If the inter-nuclear separation is
$R$ then clearly when $R \to \infty$ we would expect the electronic structure to
be that of two separate atoms, as described in texts such as
Foot~\cite{Foot2005}.

\ph{We have already discussed} decreasing $R$ for two \ce{H} atoms in their
ground state, which guides us to the gerade and ungerade electron wavefunctions
for the ground state of a \ce{H2} molecule. We will now further justify this
result and discuss larger molecules.

\subsubsection{Molecular orbital theory}

%TODO I wrote a fair bit of this based on HandW sec. 13 and talking to Freddy,
%needs proper citation and a bit more research.

%Molecular orbital (MO) theory is describes to good (how good?) approxiation the electron
%orbitals for small (how small)
%homonuclear (really? if so why not heteronuclear?) diatmoic molecules.
Recall that for \ce{H2} in the ground state, the 1s atomic orbital was split into the
even and uneven molecular orbitals
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_\text{g,u} 1\mathrm{s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( 1\mathrm{s}_a \pm
  1\mathrm{s}_b ).
\end{equation}
%
What will we see happen for higher orbitals? Consider \ce{Li2+}. We know that
for \ce{Li} the atomic structure is $\text{1s}^2\text{2s}$. We can anticipate
that nothing will change for the 1s orbitals, we will still get the even and
uneven solutions as in equation \ph{TODO}. Going one step further, there is
nothing inherently different for the 2s orbitals, so they will also form one
bonding and one anti-bonding orbital. We now have four molecular orbitals, which
we label 2s$\sigma^*$, 2s$\sigma$, 1s$\sigma^*$, and 1s$\sigma$.  The
corresponding molecular orbit diagram is shown in \myfigref{diaspec:fig:LiMO}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the Li MO diagram as can be foudn on the MO
  WIki page.}
  \label{diaspec:fig:LiMO}
\end{figure}

The orbitals will be filled according to the same rules as for atoms~\cite{}:
%
% TODO expand
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aufbau
    \item Pauli
    \item Hund
\end{enumerate}
%
We can see that in \ce{Li2+} that there are four electrons in bonding orbitals
and only two in anti-bonding orbitals. The overall energy contribution of the
bond is negative, so \ce{Li2+}  is a stable molecule.

Now briefly consider \ce{He2}, shown in \myfigref{diaspec:fig:HeMO}. Here the
energy contribution to the bond is net positive (there are an equal number of
electrons in bonding and anti-bonding orbitals) so this is an unstable
configureation. This is as we expect, \ce{He} is a noble gas after all. However,
if one of the 1s$\sigma^*$ electrons is excited into 2s$\sigma$ then the
\ce{He2} molecule becomes stable. This is an example of an excimer.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the He MO diagram as in HW fig. 13.3.}
  \label{diaspec:fig:HeMO}
\end{figure}

% TODO Is this really Hartree-Fock? I think it is...

Higher molecular orbitals will also be formed from a linear combination of
atomic orbitals (LCAO). In other words we write the wave function of an orbital
$\psi_i$ in terms of the overlapping atomic orbitals of similar energy $\phi_i$
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i = \sum_j c_{ji} \phi_j
\end{equation}
%
where we need to determine the coefficients $c_{ji}$. This can be achieved by
using the variational principle. We have already assumed one result of LCAO: the
even and odd solutions for \ce{H2+} \ph{ref. eqn.} This result can now be
derived as an example.

% From: https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/New_York_University/CHEM-UA_127%3A_Advanced_General_Chemistry_I/14%3A_Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals

We know that the two atomic orbtials are the 1s states of hydrogen
%
\begin{equation}
  \phi_j(r) = \frac{e^{-\abs{r - r_i}/a_0}}{\sqrt{\pi a_0^3}}
\end{equation}
%
and the electronic part of the Hamiltonian is 
%
\begin{equation}
  H_e = - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{\abs{r-r_1}} +
  \frac{1}{\abs{r-r_2}}\right).
\end{equation}
% This isn't really the variational principle, the next bit is...
\ph{Using the variational principle}, the energy of the state $\psi_j$ is
%
\begin{equation}
  E_j = \frac{\int \psi_j^\dagger H_e \psi_j \dd V}{\int \psi_j^\dagger \psi_j.
  \dd V}
\end{equation}
%
We seek to minimise $E_j$ with respect to $c_{ji}$. So re-write as
%
\begin{equation}
  E_j = \frac{H_{11}(c_{j1}^2 + c_{j2}^2) + 2H_{12}c_{j1}c_{j2}}{c_{j1}^2
  + c_{j2}^2 + 2Sc_{j1}c_{j2}}
\end{equation}
%TODO make sure S= < phi_1 | phi_2> is defined above (maybe called J or K?
%
where we define the integral $H_{ij} = \int \phi_i^\dagger H_e \phi_j \dd V$ and
note that $H_{11} = H_{22}$. Minimisation is left as an exercise, the reader
should find that
%
\begin{equation}
  c_{j1} = \pm c_{j2}.
\end{equation}
%
Together with the normalisation condition, we have two possible solutions, so
$\j \in \{ +, - \}$, and
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi_\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_1 \pm \phi_2)
\end{equation}
%
just as we supposed in \ph{ref equation or section}.

Now the energies can be found by solving the Schrodinger equation, to find that
%
\begin{equation}
  E_\pm(R) = \frac{H_{11}(R) \pm H_{12}(R)}{1 \pm S(R)} + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi
  \epsilon_0 R}.
\end{equation}
%
The resulting orbital energies are plotted in \myfigref{:diaspec:fig:Henergies},
along with results from experiment. Clearly LCAO makes for a decent first
approximation of the energy structure of atomic orbitals, but it is not a
complete description. The complete picture will require us to compute the
self-consistent solution for all interaction between electrons and nucleons (see
chapter four of Foot~\cite{Foot2005}). It is not practical to discuss these more
complete methods in this text and MO theory is enough to give us intution of the
way that molecular orbitals arise from mixing of atomic orbitals. We can
continue to extend this to larger diatomic molecules.

% TODO Is there really no more that I need to say?

\end{figure}

Figure \myfigref{diaspec:fig:2ndperiod} shows the MO diagrams for the
homonuclear diatomics formed of elements in the second period. MO theory is not
able to accurately explain the shift in energies, but we assert that these can
be obtained from experiment \cm{cite?}.

% TODO better cite than: https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/8-4-molecular-orbital-theory/
We can also explain the changing energetic order of the bonds via \emph{s-p
mixing}. Recall that we assumed that the LCAO mixed atomic orbitals of similar
energies. We therefore expect that if an atom has s and p orbitals of similar
energy, then these will be mixed in the molecular state. This is what happends
for the smaller atoms in the period. Oxygen, fluorine and neon have $\text{2p}$
orbitals with paired electrons. This means these orbitals have higher energy
than the smaller atoms in the period and there is no s-p mixing.

Now consider the electrons filling the molecular orbitals. Again we follow the
rules set out above. The filling for \ce{N2} and \ce{O2} is shown in
\myfigref{diaspec:fig:N2O2}. MO theory is able to predict the paramagnetism of
\ce{O2} due to the unpaired electrons in the $\text{2p}\pi^*$ orbital.

\subsection{Nuclear motion}

\subsection{Raman spectroscopy}

Raman scattering describes the process of the interaction of off-resonant light
with a molecule.  Light incident on a diatomic molecule will induce a dipole
moment
%
\begin{equation}
  p(t) = \alpha E_0 \cos(2\pi\nu_p t)
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ is the polarisability of the molecule, and $E_0$ and $\nu_p$ are
the amplitude and frequency of the electric field respectively.

For all diatomic molecules, the polarisability is a function of the
inter-nuclear separation \cite{}, which can be expanded to first order
%
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \alpha(R) = \alpha(R_0) + \frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R}(R - R_0).
\end{equation}
%
This is where the vibration of the molecule comes into play, because of course
$R$ changes through time as the molecule vibrates. We can write down
%
\begin{equation}
R = R_0 + q \cos (2\pi \nu_\text{vib} t)
\end{equation}
and hence the dipole moment is
\begin{equation}
p(t) = \left[ \alpha(R_0) + \frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R} q\cos (2\pi\nu_\text{vib}t)
\right] E_0 \cos(2\pi\nu_p t).
\end{equation}
Expanding this out we retrieve
\begin{equation}
p(t) = \alpha(R_0)E_0\cos(2\pi\nu_p t) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dd \alpha}{\dd R}
E_0 q \left\{ \cos\left[ 2\pi(\nu_p + \nu_\text{vib})t\right]
+ \cos\left[ 2\pi(\nu_p - \nu_\text{vib})t\right] \right\}.
\end{equation}

Hence from the first order of $\alpha(R)$ we have found that the vibrational
spectrum of a diatomic molecule has a principle line at $\nu_p$ and sidebands at
$\nu_p \pm \nu_\text{vib}$. Clearly expansion to higher orders of $\alpha(R)$
will yield higher-order sidebands. This is the \emph{Raman spectrum} of the
molecule. Negative sidebands are \emph{Stokes lines} and positive are
\emph{anti-Stokes}.
%
The Raman spectrum (including the rotational contribution, which we have not yet
discussed) is shown in Figure \ref{diaspec:fig:totalraman}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the Raman spectrum, similar to H\&W 12.1}
  \label{diaspec:fig:totalraman}
\end{figure}

Upon scattering the photon, the molecule is excited to a virtual level. When the
excited state decays, it can fall back into the same level (\emph{Rayleigh
scattering}), a higher vibrational state (\emph{Stokes scattering}) or a lower
vibrational level (\emph{anti-Stokes scattering}). These processes are
illustrated in \myfigref{diaspec:fig:ramanscatter}.

\begin{figure}
  % TODO
  \caption{This figure should show the possible Raman scattering processes, some
  hybrid of the Wikipedia fig. and H\&W fig. 12.3.}
  \label{diaspec:fig:ramanscatter}
\end{figure}

The relative intensity of each line in the Stokes spectrum can be found by
considering the relative population of each vibrational level. These will be
populated according to a Boltzman distribution, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{I_\text{anti}}{I_\text{Stokes}} = \frac{n(v=1)}{n(=0)} = e^{-\beta h
  \nu_\text{vib}}.
\end{equation}
%
A typical value of $\nu_\text{vib}$ is \SI{30}{\tera\hertz} and at room
temperature (\SI{300}{\kelvin}) this results in a 0.7\% relative intensity. At
ultracold temperatures (\SI{10}{\micro \kelvin}) the relative intensity is
approximately zero ($e^{- 10^8}$).

\subsubsection{Rotational spectrum}

We will now describe the origin of the scattering lines either side of each
Rayleigh and (anti-)Stokes line in the Raman spectrum, as depicted in
\myfigref{diaspec:fig:totalraman}.
